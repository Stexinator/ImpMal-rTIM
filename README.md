# ImpMal-rTIM

![Logo](/src/assets/rtim-logo.webp)

Welcome to Roguish Tradering: Impeccable Moneymaking or rTIM (yes, I know you hate it), a homebrew collection of mine for Imperium Maledictum system. Also, some house rule(s) I rather liked.
For now, this module has:

## Homebrew
- rTIM: Base of Operations - Base building. Actor sheet and Item sheet (with compendium filled with the rooms/modules), no automation.
- rTIM: Eventful Life - Expanded Events table. Rolltable ready to go!
- rTIM: The Deck Stacked Against You - Emperor's Tarot to give out bonuses/penalties and generate ideas for Missions. Only the card deck.

## House Rules
- Alternative Initiative - Custom field to specify a custom initiative. Default is adding d10 to the initiative to make it more random.
