Welcome to Roguish Tradering: Impeccable Moneymaking or rTIM (yes, I know you hate it), a homebrew collection of mine for Imperium Maledictum system. Also, some house rule(s) I rather liked.
For now, this module has:

## Homebrew (with Journal Entries)
- rTIM: Base of Operations - Base building. Actor sheet and Item sheet (with compendium filled with the rooms/modules), no automation.
- rTIM: Eventful Life - Expanded Events table. Rolltable ready to go!
- rTIM: The Deck Stacked Against You - Emperor's Tarot to give out bonuses/penalties and generate ideas for Missions.
- rTIM: Loot Gretchin - Loot tables. The items are based on ImpMal Core module, otherwise links will be broken.

## House Rules
- Alternative Initiative - Custom field to specify a custom initiative. Default is adding d10 to the initiative to make it more random.
