Welcome to Roguish Tradering: Impeccable Moneymaking or rTIM (yes, I know you hate it), a homebrew collection of mine for Imperium Maledictum system. Also, some house rule(s) I rather liked.
For now, this module has (no automation for Homebrew unless stated otherwise):

## Homebrew (with Journal Entries)
- rTIM: Base of Operations - Base building. Actor sheet and Item sheet (with compendium filled with the rooms/modules). Example base actor.
- rTIM: Eventful Life - Expanded Events table. Rolltable ready to go!
- rTIM: The Deck Stacked Against You - Emperor's Tarot to give out bonuses/penalties and generate ideas for Missions.
- rTIM: Loot Gretchin - Loot tables. The items are based on ImpMal Core module, otherwise links will be broken.
- rTIM: Wealth of Generations - Profit Factor (and Liquid PF). Just the rules.
- rTIM: Artefact and Item Generator - Generating Items/Artefacts. Rules and rolltables! Have fun generating strange items!
- rTIM: Group Up! - Squads for low level enemies. Just the rules
- rTIM: Machineguns Akimbo - Dual wield of two-handed weapons. Just the rules and the recoil gloves.
- rTIM: Peers of the Imperium - Archetypes (for higher lvl of play, Basic only). Just the rules and talents.

## House Rules
- Alternative Initiative - Custom field to specify a custom initiative. Default is adding d10 to the initiative to make it more random.
- Critical/Fumble on All Tests - Not all tests in the system will have Critical/Fumble upon doubles, with this they will have it.
